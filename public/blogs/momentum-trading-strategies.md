# Introduction to Momentum Trading

Momentum trading represents one of the most empirically validated quantitative strategies in modern finance. At its core, momentum trading capitalizes on the tendency of securities that have performed well (or poorly) in the recent past to continue performing well (or poorly) in the near future.

## The Mathematical Foundation

The momentum effect can be quantified using various statistical measures. The most common approach involves calculating the price momentum over different time horizons:

**Simple Momentum Score:**
`M(t,k) = (P(t) - P(t-k)) / P(t-k)`

Where:
- P(t) = Current price
- P(t-k) = Price k periods ago
- M(t,k) = Momentum score

## Statistical Significance

Academic research has consistently demonstrated the momentum anomaly across various asset classes:

- **Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)**: Documented 3-12 month momentum in U.S. stocks
- **Rouwenhorst (1998)**: Found similar patterns in international markets
- **Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999)**: Extended findings to industry momentum

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Universe Selection
Begin with a liquid universe of securities with sufficient trading volume and market capitalization.

### 2. Momentum Calculation
Calculate momentum scores across multiple time horizons (1, 3, 6, 12 months) to capture different momentum regimes.

### 3. Portfolio Construction
- **Long positions**: Top decile momentum stocks
- **Short positions**: Bottom decile momentum stocks
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly frequency to maintain signal strength

### 4. Risk Management
Implement position sizing based on:
- Volatility-adjusted momentum scores
- Maximum position limits
- Sector/industry exposure constraints

## Machine Learning Enhancement

Modern momentum strategies can be enhanced using machine learning techniques:

### Feature Engineering
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Volume-based metrics
- Cross-sectional rankings
- Macroeconomic variables

### Model Selection
- **Random Forest**: Captures non-linear relationships
- **XGBoost**: Handles feature interactions effectively
- **LSTM Networks**: Models temporal dependencies

## Risk Considerations

### 1. Momentum Crashes
Momentum strategies are susceptible to sudden reversals, particularly during market stress periods.

### 2. Transaction Costs
High turnover can erode returns through transaction costs and market impact.

### 3. Capacity Constraints
Strategy performance may degrade with increased assets under management.

## Conclusion

Momentum trading remains a cornerstone of quantitative investing, offering robust risk-adjusted returns when properly implemented. The combination of statistical rigor and machine learning enhancement provides a powerful framework for modern momentum strategies.
